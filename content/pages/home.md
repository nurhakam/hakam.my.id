Hi there üëã

My name is Syaiful Nur Hakam. I'm a student, passionate learner, and a future chemist. I update this [now](/now) page regularly and write a glimpse about what I'm currently doing in there.

This is my personal site where I drop notes and articles about things that I am interested in. Generally speaking this journal will capture thought I have about learning web development, languange, philosophy, writting, and my endless curiosity with science especially chemistry.

The entries on this page aren't all complete thoughts. It's a space for me to post what I like and I try not to hoard drafts like some sort of digital Smog. Instead I choose to just let things fly and circle back to them later if I feel like it.

If you'd like to get in touch with me [email](mailto:hakam_@merahputih.id) are your best channels.

If you like something you read here, please feel free to share it and let me know. It's always nice to get feedback.

Hi there üëã

My name is Syaiful Nur Hakam. I am a first-year Japanese Literature student at Brawijaya University and a passionate learner. I update the [now](/now) page regularly and write a glimpse about what I'm currently up to in there.

This website is my personal space (some sort of digital garden) where I drop draft, notes, and article in things I'm interested in. Mostly, it will capture thoughts I have about learning foreign language, philosophy, writing, web development, and my endless curiosity with Japanese culture.

I found the idea of a blog without a publish button interesting. A concept to write entries that aren't all complete thoughts and open to edit or add things later on. In a sense, each entry become living being that capture how the thought is evolving over time.

If you'd like to get in touch with me, [email](mailto:say.hi@hakam.my.id) are your best channels. You can also DM me in [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/syaifulnurh/).

Please feel free to share and let me know if you like something you read here. It's always nice to get feedback.

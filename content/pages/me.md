Currently struggling to catch up learning Japanese. Online class is suck. Remember that habit is always number one for studying foreign language.

Preparing #Monad project. Post something useful, short, and interesting in instagram. Personal growth is hot topic right now. Growing up and becoming an adult is not easy.

"I am a undergraduate student, I seek anything to learn and experience, in a world that isn't centered around, far-far away from my own corner, to the other, the unknown. What for? to find myself."

## Goals & Interests

- Being storyteller (through writing)
- Traveling around the world (Japan I'am coming!)
- Reduce environmental and social problems (uhm)
- Read books with beautiful story (I like the vibes)
- Watch good and entertaining movies (aka melancholic movies)
- Enjoy anime a lot ("Rewrite" recommended)
- Sometimes plays games too (Genshin Impact)
- Love listening to music (Sakamichi groups, japanese music in general)

I'm really happy that I passed the N4 level of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test in Dec, 2022. It was a bit challenging to stay focused during my first offline semester after WFH, especially since I was excited to see my old friends and make new ones. I ended up slacking off a bit too much and my GPA suffered, which is a bummer.

But I think it's normal to want to have fun and make memories after all the isolation we went through, right? Even so, passing the test is a big accomplishment for me and has motivated me to do better in the future. Overall, I'm just relieved and happy that I passed.

The sentence *"I seek anything to learn and experience in a world that isn't centered around, far-far away from my own corner, to the other, the unknown.  What for? To find myself"* is my favorite because it embodies my way of life. I have a strong desire to learn and gain new experiences, especially in a world that lies beyond my familiar surroundings and stretches far beyond my comfort zone. The reason for this is to gain a deeper understanding of myself and my place in the world.
